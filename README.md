  Included in this .zip file is the r file with the workflow used to analyze the participant data.
- Qualitative Analysis: Participant responses to the open-ended questions including the manipulation checks, justifications and additional deceptor questions. This file includes the interrater reliability coding between researchers.
- Hidden State Third Person POV: Analysis comparing the Hidden state condition from the first and third person points of view.

In addition to the datasets included in the main analysis, the following files contain pilot testing data:
- Deception Study 0: Initial pilot test of three vignettes. Included is the initial data analysis, code book and creation of main themes for possible justifications for the robots behavior.
- September 6th Pilot Test: Confirmation of the presence of the justification themes found in Study 0 using the newly developed code book. This file set contains data analysis and interrater reliabilities for the coders.
